## Solution

When we first login using the password you found in last level. You find data.txt in the present directory.It was instructed to work in /tmp/any_arbit_dir. So let's just create a new directory and copy this file there.

```$mkdir /tmp/lvl1213 && cp data.txt /tmp/lvl1213```

now just migrate to the directory ```cd /tmp/lvl1213```

On doing ``` $file data.txt``` we get ```$data.txt: ASCII text```. Hint is this file has been repeatedly compressed and it is a hexdump of it. Let's just reverse hexdump it.

```$xxd -r data.txt > data```

```$file data```

```$data: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", last modified: Thu Dec 28 13:34:36 2017, max compression, from Unix```
